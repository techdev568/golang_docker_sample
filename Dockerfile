#COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve a similar purpose. They let you copy files from a specific location into a Docker image.
#ADD  does that same but in addition, it also supports 2 other sources. 
    #A URL instead of a local file/directory.
    #Extract tar from the source directory into the destination.
